    "QUESTION 1: Why is documentation more important in team projects than solo projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "Documentation is more important in team projects for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Communication Across Team Members: In a team, multiple developers work on \n",
    "   different parts of the codebase. Good documentation allows team members to \n",
    "   understand each other's code without constant verbal communication or meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Onboarding New Team Members: When new developers join the project, comprehensive \n",
    "   documentation allows them to get up to speed quickly without requiring extensive \n",
    "   training from existing team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reducing Dependencies: Without documentation, team members become dependent on \n",
    "   the original code author for explanations. This creates bottlenecks when that \n",
    "   person is unavailable or leaves the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preventing Assumptions: Different developers may make different assumptions \n",
    "   about how code should work. Documentation makes expectations explicit and \n",
    "   prevents bugs caused by misunderstandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Code Reviews: Documentation makes code reviews more efficient because reviewers \n",
    "   can quickly understand the intent and validate that the implementation matches \n",
    "   the documented behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Maintenance: When bugs need to be fixed months later, documentation helps the \n",
    "   person fixing the bug (who may not be the original author) understand the \n",
    "   original design decisions and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
