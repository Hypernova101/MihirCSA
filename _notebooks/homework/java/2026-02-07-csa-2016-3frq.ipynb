    "\n",
    "### Part A: toBeLabeled Method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "The `toBeLabeled` method determines whether a square at position (r, c) in a crossword puzzle grid should receive a positive number label according to the crossword labeling rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Crossword Labeling Rule Breakdown\n",
    "A square gets labeled if and only if:\n",
    "1. The square is WHITE (not black), AND\n",
    "2. At least ONE of these conditions is true:\n",
    "   - The square has no white square immediately above it (either at top row OR black square above)\n",
    "   - The square has no white square immediately to its left (either at leftmost column OR black square to left)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Complete Expression**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "return (!(blackSquares[r][c]) &&\n",
    "    (r == 0 || c == 0 || blackSquares[r - 1][c] ||\n",
    "        blackSquares[r][c - 1]));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me break this down into digestible pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Check if square is white**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "!(blackSquares[r][c])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `blackSquares[r][c]` is `true` if the square is black, `false` if white\n",
    "- The `!` (NOT operator) flips this: `true` if white, `false` if black\n",
    "- If this is `false` (square is black), the entire expression returns `false` immediately due to the `&&` operator\n",
    "- Black squares can NEVER be labeled\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Check labeling conditions (within parentheses)**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "(r == 0 || c == 0 || blackSquares[r - 1][c] || blackSquares[r][c - 1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses short-circuit evaluation with the `||` (OR) operator. Java evaluates left-to-right and stops as soon as it finds `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me trace through each condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`r == 0`** - Is this the top row?\n",
    "   - If yes, there's no square above (boundary condition)\n",
    "   - The square should be labeled (return `true`)\n",
    "   - Java doesn't evaluate the rest (short-circuit)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`c == 0`** - Is this the leftmost column?\n",
    "   - Only checked if `r == 0` was `false`\n",
    "   - If yes, there's no square to the left (boundary condition)\n",
    "   - The square should be labeled (return `true`)\n",
    "   - Java doesn't evaluate the rest (short-circuit)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`blackSquares[r - 1][c]`** - Is the square above black?\n",
    "   - Only checked if both `r == 0` and `c == 0` were `false`\n",
    "   - Safe to check `r - 1` because we know `r > 0`\n",
    "   - If `true`, the square above is black (no white square above)\n",
    "   - The square should be labeled (return `true`)\n",
    "   - Java doesn't evaluate the rest (short-circuit)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`blackSquares[r][c - 1]`** - Is the square to the left black?\n",
    "   - Only checked if all previous conditions were `false`\n",
    "   - Safe to check `c - 1` because we know `c > 0`\n",
    "   - If `true`, the square to the left is black (no white square to left)\n",
    "   - The square should be labeled (return `true`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight: The OR Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "The square is labeled if ANY of these is true:\n",
    "- Top row (automatic label)\n",
    "- Leftmost column (automatic label)\n",
    "- Has black square above (starts vertical word)\n",
    "- Has black square to left (starts horizontal word)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we use `||` (OR) not `&&` (AND). Only ONE condition needs to be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical: Short-Circuit Evaluation Prevents Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider what would happen WITHOUT short-circuit evaluation at position (0, 1):\n",
    "- `r == 0` is `true` (top row)\n",
    "- If we checked `blackSquares[r - 1][c]` anyway, we'd access `blackSquares[-1][c]`\n",
    "- This would throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`\n",
    "\n",
    "But with `||`, once `r == 0` evaluates to `true`, Java STOPS and returns `true` immediately, never checking the dangerous array access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B: Crossword Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "The constructor must create a 2D array of `Square` objects with the same dimensions as the input `blackSquares` array, where each Square has:\n",
    "- Correct color (black or white)\n",
    "- Correct number (positive label for labeled squares, 0 for others)\n",
    "- Labels assigned consecutively in row-major order starting at 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initialize the puzzle array**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "puzzle = new Square[blackSquares.length][blackSquares[0].length];\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `blackSquares.length` gives the number of rows\n",
    "- `blackSquares[0].length` gives the number of columns (length of first row)\n",
    "- Creates a 2D array with same dimensions as input\n",
    "- Initially all elements are `null` (default for object arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Initialize label counter**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int num = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Labels start at 1 (not 0)\n",
    "- This variable tracks the next label to assign\n",
    "- Only increments when we actually assign a label\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Nested loop - Row-Major Traversal**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int r = 0; r < blackSquares.length; r++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for (int c = 0; c < blackSquares[0].length; c++)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Outer loop iterates through rows (0 to length-1)\n",
    "- Inner loop iterates through columns (0 to length-1)\n",
    "- **Row-major order**: Process row 0 completely (all columns), then row 1 completely, etc.\n",
    "- This ensures consecutive labeling: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Determine square type and create Square object**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic has three cases handled by nested if-else:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1: Black square**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (blackSquares[r][c])\n",
    "{\n",
    "    puzzle[r][c] = new Square(true, 0);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If `blackSquares[r][c]` is `true`, this is a black square\n",
    "- Create a black Square (`true` as first parameter)\n",
    "- Black squares always get number 0\n",
    "- Do NOT increment `num` (black squares never get labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: White square that should be labeled**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if (toBeLabeled(r, c, blackSquares))\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        puzzle[r][c] = new Square(false, num);\n",
    "        num++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "- We're in the `else`, so we know it's white\n",
    "- Call `toBeLabeled` to check if this white square should be labeled\n",
    "- If yes, create white Square (`false`) with current label number\n",
    "- **Critical**: Increment `num` AFTER using it (post-increment pattern)\n",
    "- Next labeled square will get the next consecutive number\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 3: White square that should NOT be labeled**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    else\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        puzzle[r][c] = new Square(false, 0);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- White square that doesn't meet labeling criteria\n",
    "- Create white Square with number 0 (unlabeled)\n",
    "- Do NOT increment `num`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Order Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The nested if-else structure handles three mutually exclusive cases:\n",
    "1. Black (skip labeling logic entirely)\n",
    "2. White AND should be labeled (use and increment counter)\n",
    "3. White AND should NOT be labeled (no counter change)\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing in row-major order while maintaining a single counter ensures consecutive numbering:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Grid positions:  Labels assigned:\n",
    "(0,0) → 1\n",
    "(0,1) → 2\n",
    "(0,2) → (not labeled)\n",
    "(1,0) → 3\n",
    "(1,1) → (not labeled)\n",

    "## Area of Struggle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: Understanding the Boolean Logic Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the compound boolean expression was overwhelming:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "return (!(blackSquares[r][c]) &&\n",
    "    (r == 0 || c == 0 || blackSquares[r - 1][c] ||\n",
    "        blackSquares[r][c - 1]));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**My confusion:**\n",
    "- Why so many `||` (OR) operators?\n",
    "- Why check `r == 0` before `blackSquares[r - 1][c]`?\n",
    "- Does the order matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I understood it:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I drew a truth table for a simple case:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Position (1,1) in a 3x3 grid:\n",
    "- blackSquares[1][1] = false (white)\n",
    "- r == 0? No\n",
    "- c == 0? No  \n",
    "- blackSquares[0][1] = ? (square above)\n",
    "- blackSquares[1][0] = ? (square to left)\n",
    "\n",
    "For labeling to be true:\n",
    "Square above is BLACK OR square to left is BLACK\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I realized: we check `r == 0` FIRST because if it's true, we don't need to (and CAN'T safely) check `blackSquares[r-1][c]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"aha\" moment:** The OR conditions represent different ways a square can qualify for labeling. A crossword clue can start at:\n",
    "- The top edge (r == 0)\n",
    "- The left edge (c == 0)\n",
    "- After a black square vertically (blackSquares[r-1][c])\n",
    "- After a black square horizontally (blackSquares[r][c-1])\n",
    "\n",
    "Any ONE of these makes it a starting square for a word, so it gets labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I overcame it:** I traced through several examples by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Position (0, 0) - Black square\n",
    "- `!(blackSquares[0][0])` = `!(true)` = `false`\n",
    "- Result: `false` (short-circuit, never check rest)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Position (0, 1) - White square, top row\n",
    "- `!(blackSquares[0][1])` = `!(false)` = `true`\n",
    "- `r == 0` = `true`\n",
    "- Result: `true && true` = `true` (labeled)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Position (1, 1) - White square with white neighbors\n",
    "- `!(blackSquares[1][1])` = `true`\n",
    "- `r == 0` = `false`\n",
    "- `c == 0` = `false`\n",
    "- `blackSquares[0][1]` = `false` (white above)\n",
    "- `blackSquares[1][0]` = `false` (white to left)\n",
    "- Result: `true && false` = `false` (not labeled)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: Array Index Out of Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "My first attempt didn't consider boundary checking:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// WRONG - crashes at edges\n",
    "return !blackSquares[r][c] && \n",
    "       (blackSquares[r-1][c] || blackSquares[r][c-1]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:**\n",
    "- At (0, 0), checking `blackSquares[r-1][c]` tries to access `blackSquares[-1][0]`\n",
    "- This throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** Always check boundary conditions BEFORE array access:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "r == 0 || blackSquares[r - 1][c]  // If r==0, never evaluate blackSquares[r-1][c]\n",
    "c == 0 || blackSquares[r][c - 1]  // If c==0, never evaluate blackSquares[r][c-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-circuit evaluation saves us:\n",
    "- `||` evaluates left to right\n",
    "- If left side is `true`, right side is never evaluated\n",
    "- So `r == 0` being true prevents the dangerous array access\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I overcame it:** I tested my code with a grid where the top-left corner was white. When it crashed, I realized I needed to check the boundary conditions first. I then learned about short-circuit evaluation and how `||` can be used as a safety mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Understanding Row-Major Order and Label Incrementing\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part B, I initially struggled with when to increment the `num` counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My first (wrong) attempt:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int r = 0; r < blackSquares.length; r++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for (int c = 0; c < blackSquares[0].length; c++)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (blackSquares[r][c])\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            puzzle[r][c] = new Square(true, num);  // WRONG - black squares get numbers\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        else if (toBeLabeled(r, c, blackSquares))\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            puzzle[r][c] = new Square(false, num);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        else\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            puzzle[r][c] = new Square(false, 0);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        num++;  // WRONG - increments for every square\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problems:**\n",
    "1. Black squares were getting non-zero numbers\n",
    "2. Labels weren't consecutive (had gaps where black squares were)\n",
    "3. Unlabeled white squares were getting labels\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fix:**\n",
    "- Only increment `num` inside the `toBeLabeled` if-block\n",
    "- Give black squares and unlabeled white squares a number of 0\n",
    "- Let row-major traversal naturally create consecutive numbering\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I overcame it:** I traced through a small example grid on paper:\n",
    "```\n",
    "B W W     Expected:  BLACK 1   2\n",
    "W W B  →            3     0   BLACK\n",
    "W B W                4     BLACK 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote out what `num` should be after processing each square:\n",
    "- (0,0): Black, num stays 1\n",
    "- (0,1): White labeled, use 1, num becomes 2\n",
    "- (0,2): White labeled, use 2, num becomes 3\n",
    "- (1,0): White labeled, use 3, num becomes 4\n",
    "- (1,1): White not labeled, num stays 4\n",
    "- (1,2): Black, num stays 4\n",
    "- (2,0): White labeled, use 4, num becomes 5\n",
    "- (2,1): Black, num stays 5\n",
    "- (2,2): White labeled, use 5, num becomes 6\n",
    "\n",
    "This made me realize `num` should ONLY increment when actually used for a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 4: Using toBeLabeled Correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem stated: \"You must use toBeLabeled appropriately to receive full credit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I considered reimplementing the labeling logic directly in the constructor:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// WRONG - doesn't use toBeLabeled\n",
    "if (!blackSquares[r][c] && (r == 0 || c == 0 || ...))\n",
    "{\n",
    "    puzzle[r][c] = new Square(false, num);\n",
    "    num++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the rubric required calling `toBeLabeled`. The correct approach:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (toBeLabeled(r, c, blackSquares))\n",
    "{\n",
    "    puzzle[r][c] = new Square(false, num);\n",
    "    num++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I overcame it:** I carefully read the problem statement which said \"Assume that toBeLabeled works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).\" This told me:\n",
    "1. I MUST call toBeLabeled\n",
    "2. I can trust it to work correctly\n",
    "3. I shouldn't reimplement its logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common pattern in FRQs - using methods from earlier parts even if you're not sure your implementation was perfect.\n",

    "- **Array Initialization**: Creating a 2D array with dimensions based on another array\n",
    "- **Counter Management**: Incrementing a counter only when appropriate to maintain consecutive numbering\n",
    "- **Conditional Logic**: Using nested if-else statements to handle mutually exclusive cases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This FRQ reinforced several critical programming concepts. The most important lesson was understanding how to safely check neighboring elements in a 2D array by always checking boundary conditions first and leveraging short-circuit evaluation to prevent runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem demonstrated the power of method decomposition and code reuse. By creating the `toBeLabeled` helper method first, the constructor logic became significantly clearer and easier to implement. Rather than duplicating the complex labeling logic, I could simply call `toBeLabeled` for each square. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes the code more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding boolean logic and operator precedence was crucial. The expression in `toBeLabeled` combines NOT, AND, and OR operators in a specific order. The parentheses make the precedence explicit: first check if the square is white (NOT), then check if any labeling condition is met (OR conditions), then combine these with AND.\n",
    "\n",
    "Row-major traversal is a fundamental pattern for 2D array problems. The pattern of using nested loops (outer for rows, inner for columns) with all processing in the innermost loop appears frequently in AP Computer Science A. Understanding that \"row-major order\" means we completely process row 0, then completely process row 1, etc., is essential for problems involving sequential processing or consecutive numbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem also highlighted the importance of careful counter management. The `num` variable had to be incremented at exactly the right place - only when a label was actually assigned. Incrementing it elsewhere would break the consecutive numbering requirement. This precision in control flow is critical for algorithm correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the problem required managing three distinct cases when creating Square objects: black squares (always unlabeled), labeled white squares (meeting specific criteria), and unlabeled white squares (not meeting criteria). Using a nested if-else structure to handle these mutually exclusive cases is cleaner and more maintainable than trying to handle all cases with complex boolean conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crossword labeling rule itself models a real-world constraint - in actual crosswords, numbered squares indicate where words begin, which happens at the grid edge or after a black square. Translating this real-world rule into precise boolean logic demonstrates how programming can model domain-specific requirements."
