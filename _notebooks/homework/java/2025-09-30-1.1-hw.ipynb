    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Gather all ingredients: flour, yeast, warm water, salt, olive oil, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and desired toppings\n",
    "2. Mix 2 cups of flour, 1 packet of yeast, 1 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl\n",
    "3. Add 3/4 cup of warm water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the dry ingredients and knead for 8-10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic\n",
    "4. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour until it doubles in size\n",
    "5. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C) and lightly oil a pizza pan or baking sheet\n",
    "6. Punch down the dough, roll it out into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface, and transfer to the prepared pan\n",
    "7. Spread 1/2 cup of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust\n",
    "8. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add your chosen toppings (pepperoni, vegetables, etc.)\n",
    "9. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned\n",
    "10. Remove from oven, let cool for 2-3 minutes, slice into 8 pieces, and serve\n",
