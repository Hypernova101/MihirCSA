    "## Detailed Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Variables (Properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "I needed five instance variables to track the game state:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `team1Name` and `team2Name`: Store the names of both teams as Strings\n",
    "- `team1Score` and `team2Score`: Store the current scores for each team as integers\n",
    "- `activeTeam`: Tracks which team is currently playing (1 for team1, 2 for team2)\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables are declared as `private` to follow encapsulation principles and prevent direct access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor: `Scoreboard(String team1Name, String team2Name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor initializes a new game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Takes two parameters: the names of team 1 and team 2\n",
    "2. Assigns the team names to the instance variables using `this.` to distinguish between parameters and instance variables\n",
    "3. Initializes both scores to 0 since the game starts with no points\n",
    "4. Sets activeTeam to 1 because the problem states \"the game always begins with team 1 as the active team\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method: `recordPlay(int points)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method updates the game state based on a play:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic Flow:\n",
    "1. If points > 0 (successful play):\n",
    "   - Check which team is active using an if-else statement\n",
    "   - Add the points to that team's score using `+=`\n",
    "   - The active team does NOT change (team keeps playing)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If points == 0 (failed play):\n",
    "   - Switch the active team\n",
    "   - If team 1 was active, set activeTeam to 2\n",
    "   - If team 2 was active, set activeTeam to 1\n",
    "   - No points are added\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight: The method uses the `activeTeam` variable to determine which team's score to update, and only switches teams on a failed play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method: `getScore()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns the current game state as a formatted String:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determines the active team's name: Uses an if-else to check if activeTeam is 1 or 2, then gets the corresponding name\n",
    "2. Builds the return String in the format: `\"score1-score2-activeName\"`\n",
    "3. Uses string concatenation with the `+` operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output: `\"1-8-Red\"` means Team 1 has 1 point, Team 2 has 8 points, and Red (Team 1) is currently active.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Test Results / Proof of Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Step 2) info = 0-0-Red\n",
    "(Step 4) info = 1-0-Red\n",
    "(Step 6) info = 1-0-Blue\n",
    "(Step 7) info = 1-0-Blue\n",
    "(Step 9) info = 1-3-Blue\n",
    "(Step 12) info = 1-4-Red\n",
    "(Step 16) info = 1-8-Red\n",
    "(Step 18) match info = 0-0-Lions\n",
    "(Step 19) game info = 1-8-Red\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output matches the expected results, showing that:\n",
    "- Teams alternate properly when plays fail\n",
    "- Scores accumulate correctly during successful plays\n",
    "- Multiple Scoreboard objects can exist independently (game vs. match)\n",
    "- The getScore method returns the correct format\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Area of Struggle\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Managing the activeTeam switching logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I struggled with understanding exactly when the active team should change. My first instinct was to switch teams after every play, but the problem clearly states that:\n",
    "- The active team continues if they score points (points > 0)\n",
    "- The active team switches only when the play fails (points == 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to carefully re-read the problem statement and trace through the examples to understand this pattern. The key was recognizing that `recordPlay(int points)` uses the value 0 as a special signal meaning \"turn over,\" not just \"no points scored this time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another minor challenge was deciding how to represent which team is active. I considered using a boolean (`isTeam1Active`), but using an integer (1 or 2) made the code clearer when checking which team's score to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "How I overcame it: I traced through the example step-by-step on paper, writing out the value of `activeTeam` and both scores after each method call. This helped me visualize the pattern and confirm my logic was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming: Creating a class with encapsulated data\n",
    "- Constructors: Initializing object state\n",
    "- Instance Variables: Maintaining state across method calls\n",
    "- Conditional Logic: Using if-else statements to make decisions\n",
    "- String Manipulation: Building formatted strings with concatenation\n",
    "- Method Design: Creating methods that perform specific tasks (void vs. return types)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This FRQ reinforced the importance of carefully reading problem specifications. The alternating turn mechanism and the special meaning of a 0-point play required careful attention to detail. The problem also demonstrated how instance variables allow an object to \"remember\" its state between method calls, which is fundamental to object-oriented programming."
