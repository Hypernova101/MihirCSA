    "## Detailed Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A: simulateOneDay Method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instance Variable\n",
    "I needed one instance variable to track the state:\n",
    "- `currentFood`: Stores the amount of food (in grams) currently in the feeder as an integer\n",
    "- Declared as `private` to follow encapsulation principles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Determine if a bear visits (5% chance)**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "double chance = Math.random();\n",
    "\n",
    "// 5% chance a bear visits\n",
    "if (chance < 0.05)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    currentFood = 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `Math.random()` generates a random double between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)\n",
    "- Values from 0.0 to 0.049999... represent approximately 5% of the range\n",
    "- If a bear visits, it empties the feeder completely, so `currentFood` becomes 0\n",
    "- The method ends here if a bear visits (no birds eat)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: If no bear, birds eat (95% chance)**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int gramsPerBird = (int)(Math.random() * 41) + 10; // 10–50 inclusive\n",
    "    int totalConsumed = numBirds * gramsPerBird;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Each bird eats the same random amount between 10 and 50 grams (inclusive)\n",
    "- Formula breakdown: `(int)(Math.random() * 41) + 10`\n",
    "  - `Math.random() * 41` gives a double from 0.0 to 40.999...\n",
    "  - `(int)` truncates to give integers 0 through 40\n",
    "  - Adding 10 gives the range 10 through 50 (inclusive)\n",
    "- `totalConsumed` is the total amount all birds want to eat\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Update currentFood based on available food**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    if (totalConsumed > currentFood)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        currentFood = 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        currentFood -= totalConsumed;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If birds try to eat more than what's available, they empty the feeder (not enough to satisfy all)\n",
    "- Otherwise, subtract the amount consumed from currentFood\n",
    "- Key insight: Using `>` not `>=` because if `totalConsumed == currentFood`, the birds can eat exactly that amount and empty the feeder to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B: simulateManyDays Method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Purpose\n",
    "The method simulates multiple consecutive days at the feeder and counts how many days had food available for visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initialize counter**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int daysWithFood = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This tracks the number of days where the feeder had food at the start of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Loop through potential days**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int day = 0; day < numDays; day++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "```\n",
    "The loop runs up to `numDays` times, but can stop early if the feeder runs out of food.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Check if feeder is empty**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    if (currentFood == 0)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If there's no food left, no visitors can find food, so we stop the simulation\n",
    "- `break` exits the loop immediately\n",
    "- Important: This check happens BEFORE incrementing `daysWithFood` and calling `simulateOneDay`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Count the day and simulate it**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    daysWithFood++;\n",
    "    simulateOneDay(numBirds);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Since we passed the empty check, visitors will find food today, so increment the counter\n",
    "- Then call `simulateOneDay` to simulate what happens (birds eat or bear visits)\n",
    "- Key insight: We increment BEFORE simulating because the day counts if there's food at the START, even if the feeder becomes empty during the day\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Return the count**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "return daysWithFood;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Returns the total number of days where food was available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Results / Proof of Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Starting food: 2400\n",
    "Simulating 10 birds over 4 days\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible output (results vary due to randomness):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Starting food: 2400\n",
    "Days with food: 4\n",
    "Remaining food: 1560\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows:\n",
    "- Started with 2400 grams\n",
    "- All 4 days had food available at the start\n",
    "- Each day 10 birds ate (or a bear visited)\n",
    "- 840 grams were consumed total across 4 days\n",
    "- Feeder still has food remaining\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test 1: Feeder empties mid-simulation**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Starting food: 50\n",
    "Simulating 2 birds over 10 days\n",
    "Expected: ~3 days (feeder runs out quickly)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test 2: Feeder starts empty**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Starting food: 0\n",
    "Simulating 5 birds over 5 days\n",
    "Expected: 0 days (no food available any day)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Area of Struggle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: Understanding when to count a day\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I wasn't sure whether to count a day if the feeder became empty DURING that day. The problem states \"the number of days birds or a bear found food\" - the key word is \"found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**My confusion:**\n",
    "- Should I count the day if birds arrive and empty the feeder?\n",
    "- Or only count days where food remains after the visit?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** The day counts if there's food at the START of the day (when visitors arrive). Even if they empty it completely, they still \"found food,\" so the day counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the logic is:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (currentFood == 0)     // Check BEFORE counting\n",
    "{\n",
    "    break;\n",
    "}\n",
    "daysWithFood++;           // Count the day\n",
    "simulateOneDay(numBirds); // Then simulate (might empty feeder)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "simulateOneDay(numBirds); // Simulate first\n",
    "if (currentFood > 0)      // Then check if still has food\n",
    "{\n",
    "    daysWithFood++;       // WRONG ORDER!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: The order of operations in the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially placed `simulateOneDay(numBirds)` before incrementing `daysWithFood`, which caused incorrect counting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why order matters:**\n",
    "1. **Check if empty** - No food means no visitors can come\n",
    "2. **Count the day** - Food exists, so count it\n",
    "3. **Simulate the day** - Then see what happens\n",
    "\n",
    "If I simulated first, then checked and counted, I would miss counting the final day when the feeder gets emptied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I overcame it:** I traced through the example from the problem:\n",
    "- Day 1: 2400g → simulate → maybe 2160g left → counted\n",
    "- Day 2: 2160g → simulate → maybe 1920g left → counted\n",
    "- Day 3: 1920g → simulate → maybe 1680g left → counted\n",
    "- Day 4: 1680g → simulate → maybe 1440g left → counted\n",
    "- Returns 4 (all days had food at start)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Understanding break vs return\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially considered using `return daysWithFood` inside the if statement instead of `break`. However, this would have been functionally equivalent but less clear. Using `break` makes it obvious we're exiting the loop early, then returning the result after the loop completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Number Generation**: Using `Math.random()` to generate probabilities and random ranges\n",
    "- **Conditional Logic**: Using if-else statements to handle different scenarios\n",
    "- **Loop Control**: Using for loops with early termination via `break`\n",
    "- **Method Calls**: Calling helper methods (`simulateOneDay`) appropriately\n",
    "- **State Management**: Tracking and updating instance variables across method calls\n",
    "- **Edge Case Handling**: Dealing with empty feeders and early termination\n",
    "- **Integer Arithmetic**: Calculating ranges and totals with integer operations\n",
    "- **Casting**: Converting doubles to integers with `(int)` for random number generation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This FRQ reinforced the importance of careful ordering in algorithms. The sequence of checking for food, counting the day, then simulating is critical to getting the correct answer. This is a common pattern in simulation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem also highlighted the difference between preconditions and postconditions. The method counts days where food was available when visitors arrived (precondition), not necessarily days where food remained after they left (postcondition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding `Math.random()` ranges was essential. The formula `(int)(Math.random() * range) + start` is fundamental for generating random integers within specific bounds. For 10-50 inclusive, the range is 41 values (50 - 10 + 1 = 41), and the start is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a helper method (`simulateOneDay`) demonstrated good software engineering practice. Part B assumed Part A worked correctly, allowing me to focus on the iteration logic rather than reimplementing the daily simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the problem illustrated the importance of testing edge cases. What happens when the feeder starts empty? What if it empties on the first day? These scenarios help verify the logic is correct in all situations."
