    "# Practice Exam 2 MCQ — Reflection\n",

    "\n",
    "I scored **34/42 (81%)** on Practice Exam 2 MCQ, completed in 1 hour and 7 minutes. I think timing wise this is good, because in the real exam, I will be a bit stressed and so practicing while being under time is good. Overall I got a decent score, but there are 8 questions I got wrong and I want to actually understand why instead of just moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "By unit, my performance broke down like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Unit | Questions | Score |\n",
    "|------|-----------|-------|\n",
    "| Unit 1: Using Objects and Methods | 11 | 73% |\n",
    "| Unit 2: Selection and Iteration | 12 | 75% |\n",
    "| Unit 3: Class Creation | 9 | 89% |\n",
    "| Unit 4: Data Collections | 15 | 93% |\n",
    "\n",
    "Units 1 and 2 are clearly where I'm losing the most points. By skill, my two weakest areas were **Skill 2.A** (writing code to implement an algorithm) at 60% and **Skill 3.C** (determining output from code with procedural abstractions) at 50%. Everything else was 75% or above, with most skills hitting 100%. The pattern I'm noticing is that I struggle most when I need to carefully trace through code execution — not necessarily because I don't understand the concepts, but because I'm making careless tracing errors.\n",

    "## Missed Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1 — Type Casting & Operator Precedence\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** How `(double)` casting interacts with integer arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose `(double)(2 / 4) + 3`, thinking the cast outside the parentheses would force the whole thing into decimal math. The correct answer was `(double) 2 / 4 + 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** I fundamentally misunderstood where the cast applies. When you write `(double)(2 / 4)`, Java evaluates `2 / 4` as integer division first — getting `0` — and *then* casts that `0` to `0.0`. The cast doesn't travel inside the parentheses. In the correct answer, `(double) 2` promotes just the `2` before the division happens, so the division becomes `2.0 / 4 = 0.5`, then `0.5 + 3 = 3.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** I need to remember that `(double)` only promotes the single operand immediately to its right. If that operand is already a grouped expression in parentheses, the integer arithmetic inside has already happened. To force floating-point division, the cast has to be on one of the operands *inside* the division. I'll practice writing out cast expressions and evaluating them step by step before picking an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2 — String `substring()` Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** How `substring(start, end)` and `substring(start)` work in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose `oldStr.substring(1, 2) + oldStr.substring(4)` thinking it would produce \"BCEF\" from \"ABCDEF\". The correct answer was `oldStr.substring(1, 3) + oldStr.substring(4)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** I got confused about the end index being exclusive. `substring(1, 2)` only returns the character at index 1, which is just \"B\" — not \"BC\". To get \"BC\", I needed `substring(1, 3)` because the end index is exclusive, meaning it goes up to but does not include index 3. I also correctly identified that `substring(4)` gives \"EF\" (from index 4 to end), so the second part of my reasoning was right — I just botched the first call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** I need to drill into my head that `substring(start, end)` includes `start` but excludes `end`. A good trick is to think of it as: the length of the returned string equals `end - start`. So if I want 2 characters starting at index 1, I need `substring(1, 3)` because `3 - 1 = 2`. I should manually index strings on scratch paper before selecting an answer on these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3 — De Morgan's Law / Boolean Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Simplifying boolean expressions using De Morgan's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose `!a && !b || c` for the expression equivalent to `!(a && b) || c`. The correct answer was `!a || !b || c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** This is a De Morgan's Law problem and I applied it wrong. De Morgan's Law says `!(a && b)` becomes `!a || !b` — when you distribute the NOT inside, the `&&` flips to `||`. I instead kept the `&&`, writing `!a && !b`, which is actually equivalent to `!(a || b)`, not `!(a && b)`. I got the negation of the individual variables right but forgot to flip the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** I need to further memorize and internalize both forms of De Morgan's Law which I may have forgotten:\n",
    "- `!(a && b)` → `!a || !b`\n",
    "- `!(a || b)` → `!a && !b`\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to remember it: the operator always flips when you distribute a NOT. AND becomes OR, OR becomes AND. I should also verify my answer by plugging in test values. The feedback said these two expressions differ when `a = true, b = false, c = false` — so I'll make a habit of testing edge cases before committing to an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4 — While Loop Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Tracing while loop execution and understanding loop boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose the loop starting at `num = 10` with `while (num > 0)`, printing before decrementing. That prints \"10987654321\" — one too many numbers. The correct answer was `while (num > 1)` with `num--` before the print, which prints \"987654321\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** I didn't carefully trace the loop. With `while (num > 0)`, num goes from 10 all the way down to 1 before exiting, printing 10 at the start. The correct loop starts at 10, immediately decrements to 9, then prints — and exits when num reaches 1 (since `1 > 1` is false). The key difference I overlooked was whether the print happens before or after the decrement, and what that does to the starting and ending values that get printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** For while loop tracing questions, I need to slow down and simulate the first two and last two iterations on paper. Specifically I should track: (1) what value is printed first, (2) what value is printed last, and (3) how many total values print. If any of those don't match the target output, the loop is wrong. I was rushing and pattern-matched on the loop condition without actually tracing execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5 — Static Variables in Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** How `static` variables behave across multiple object instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose 11 as the answer. The correct answer was 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** I forgot that `static` variables are shared across ALL instances of a class — they belong to the class, not to any individual object. In this question, `y` is `private static int y = 0`. Every time a `SomeClass` object is constructed, the constructor runs `y++`. So creating `first`, `second`, and `third` each increments y, making `y = 3`. Then `first.incrementY()` adds 1 (y = 4), and `second.incrementY(10)` adds 10 (y = 14). When `third.getY()` is called, it returns the shared `y`, which is 14. I think I forgot that constructing an object also increments y, or I miscounted the constructor calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** Whenever I see `static` on a variable, I need to remind myself: this value is shared. Every object modifies the same `y`. I should track static variable changes separately from instance variable changes, and make sure I account for constructor calls as well as explicit method calls when tracing through code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6 — String `substring()` with `indexOf()`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Tracing string manipulation using `substring()` and `indexOf()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose 2 as the value of `pos`. The correct answer was 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** The string `one = \"xyz\"`. Then `two` is built as `one.substring(2) + one.substring(1) + one.substring(0)`. I incorrectly thought `one.substring(2)` returned an empty string, but it actually returns `\"z\"` (from index 2 to the end). So `two = \"z\" + \"yz\" + \"xyz\" = \"zyzxyz\"`. Then `two.indexOf(\"x\")` finds the first \"x\" in \"zyzxyz\", which is at index 3. I was computing `two` as \"yzxyz\" (missing the leading \"z\"), which would have put \"x\" at index 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** I need to be more careful with single-argument `substring(n)` — it returns everything from index n to the end, not an empty string. If I want an empty string, that only happens when `n == string.length()`. I should write out each substring call explicitly and concatenate them on paper before reasoning about `indexOf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7 — For Loop with `substring()` Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Tracing a for loop that builds a string using `substring(k, k+1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose \"cmue\". The correct answer was \"optr\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** The loop starts at `k = 1` and increments by 2 each time (`k = k + 2`), taking one character at a time with `substring(k, k+1)`. So for \"computer\" (indices 0–7), the loop picks characters at indices 1, 3, 5, 7 — which are 'o', 'p', 't', 'r' → \"optr\". I apparently answered as if k started at 0, which would give indices 0, 2, 4, 6 → 'c', 'm', 'u', 'e' → \"cmue\". The feedback confirmed this exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** I need to read the loop initialization more carefully. Starting at `k = 1` vs `k = 0` completely changes the output. On loop tracing questions, I should write out the value of k for every iteration before identifying which characters get selected. This is a simple but critical detail I glossed over.\n",

    "### Question 8 — 2D Array / Matrix Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2mcq/8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Tracing a method that multiplies elements from a 2D array\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I did:** I chose `{1, 9, 0, 4}`. The correct answer was `{4, 0, 9, 1}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I missed it:** The method `operation(mat, 1, 2)` passes `r = 1` and `c = 2`. It loops through `j = 0` to `3`, computing `result[j] = matrix[r][j] * matrix[j][c]` — so it multiplies row 1's j-th element by column 2's j-th element. Working through it:\n",
    "- j=0: `mat[1][0] * mat[0][2]` = `2 * 2` = **4**\n",
    "- j=1: `mat[1][1] * mat[1][2]` = `0 * 3` = **0**\n",
    "- j=2: `mat[1][2] * mat[2][2]` = `3 * 3` = **9**\n",
    "- j=3: `mat[1][3] * mat[3][2]` = `1 * 1` = **1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: `{4, 0, 9, 1}`. I think I mixed up which index was `r` and which was `c`, or I swapped the row/column in the multiplication formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to improve:** 2D array questions require me to be very deliberate about notation. `matrix[r][j]` means row `r`, column `j` — I need to read carefully and not flip those. Writing the matrix out visually and labeling rows and columns before tracing would help a lot here. This is the type of question where slowing down by 30 seconds to set up the trace properly saves me from a wrong answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking across all 8 mistakes, the majority come down to one root cause: **I'm not tracing code carefully enough**. Whether it's a loop variable, an array index, a cast operator, or a string method, I'm making assumptions instead of working through the mechanics step by step. The concepts aren't the problem — the execution is.\n",
    "\n",
    "My plan going forward is to practice the \"write it out\" habit on every tracing question: slow down, put pencil to paper (or mental scratch pad), and simulate the code before picking an answer. I also plan on making use of external resources beyond just the in class practice we get, like going on Khan Academy to learn conceptual MC specific content. Since my weakest topic is following code execution, I also plan on coming up with more challenges where I have to follow some preexisting code."
