    "## FRQ 1 — RobotMover\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** You're given a `RobotMover` class that stores a string of moves a robot makes. Part A asks you to build that string randomly, and Part B asks you to search it for patterns. The string looks like `\"up_down_left_right_\"` — every move followed by an underscore as a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A: Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem Specifically:** Given `numMoves`, fill `moveSequence` with that many random directions (up/down/left/right), each followed by `_`. Every direction should have an equal 25% chance of appearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public RobotMover(int numMoves) {\n",
    "    moveSequence = \"\";\n",
    "    String[] directions = {\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\"};\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < numMoves; i++) {\n",
    "        moveSequence += directions[(int)(Math.random() * 4)] + \"_\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `moveSequence = \"\"` — initialize to empty string first, otherwise you're concatenating onto null which breaks everything\n",
    "- `String[] directions = {\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\"}` — storing all four options in an array means you can pick one with a single index instead of writing four if/else branches\n",
    "- `(int)(Math.random() * 4)` — `Math.random()` gives a decimal between 0.0 and 0.999..., multiply by 4 to stretch that range to 0.0–3.999..., then cast to int to chop off the decimal, giving you exactly 0, 1, 2, or 3\n",
    "- The `+ \"_\"` is appended in the same line as the direction — easy to forget or misplace outside the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learnings:**\n",
    "- `(int)(Math.random() * n)` is the standard formula for random int from 0 to n-1\n",
    "- Array indexing replaces if/else chains cleanly here\n",
    "- String concatenation in a loop: always initialize to `\"\"` first\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B: countOccurrences\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem Specifically:** Count how many times the string `str` appears inside `moveSequence`. The catch — overlapping matches count too. So `\"up_up\"` inside `\"up_up_up_\"` appears at index 0 AND index 3, so the answer is 2, not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int countOccurrences(String str) {\n",
    "    int count = 0;\n",
    "    int index = moveSequence.indexOf(str);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while (index != -1) {\n",
    "        count++;\n",
    "        index = moveSequence.indexOf(str, index + 1);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return count;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `moveSequence.indexOf(str)` — finds the first occurrence of `str` and returns its starting index, or -1 if not found\n",
    "- The while loop keeps going as long as `indexOf` doesn't return -1, meaning there are still matches left\n",
    "- After each match, `index + 1` moves the search forward by just one position — this is what makes overlapping matches possible. If you moved by `str.length()` instead, you'd jump past any match that shares characters with the next one\n",
    "- `count++` happens every time a match is found, then the search position updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**The overlapping problem visualized:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| moveSequence | str | Advance by length | Advance by 1 |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| `\"up_up_up_\"` | `\"up_up\"` | finds 1 | finds 2 |\n",
    "| `\"right_right_right_\"` | `\"right_right\"` | finds 1 | finds 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learnings:**\n",
    "- Two-argument `indexOf(str, fromIndex)` is essential here — know it cold\n",
    "- Always advance by 1 after a match when overlaps are possible\n",
    "- Loop condition `-1` means no more matches — standard pattern for string traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## FRQ 2 — LapTracker\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** Build a class that tracks total laps walked around a track. Every nth call to `addLaps`, the count resets to 0 before adding. The tricky part is the timing — the reset fires at the *start* of the call that comes after every nth call, not at the end of the nth call itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class LapTracker {\n",
    "    private int resetInterval;\n",
    "    private int lapCount;\n",
    "    private int callCount;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public LapTracker(int reset) {\n",
    "        resetInterval = reset;\n",
    "        lapCount = 0;\n",
    "        callCount = 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int addLaps(int laps) {\n",
    "        if (callCount % resetInterval == 0 && callCount != 0) {\n",
    "            lapCount = 0;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        callCount++;\n",
    "        lapCount += laps;\n",
    "        return lapCount;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- Three instance variables: `resetInterval` stores the constructor parameter, `lapCount` is the running total, `callCount` tracks how many times `addLaps` has been called\n",
    "- In `addLaps`, the order of operations is critical: check for reset → increment callCount → add laps → return. If you increment callCount before checking, the modulo math breaks\n",
    "- `callCount % resetInterval == 0` checks if we're at a reset point — but this is also true when `callCount` is 0 (before any calls), which is why `&& callCount != 0` is necessary to skip the very first call\n",
    "- After a reset, `lapCount = 0` and then `lapCount += laps` immediately adds the new laps, so the return value is just the new laps alone\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reset timing traced through the example (reset every 3 calls):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Call # | addLaps | callCount before check | Reset fires? | Return |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 1 | `addLaps(8)` | 0 | No (callCount == 0) | 8 |\n",
    "| 2 | `addLaps(12)` | 1 | No | 20 |\n",
    "| 3 | `addLaps(10)` | 2 | No | 30 |\n",
    "| 4 | `addLaps(11)` | 3 | Yes, 3%3==0, reset to 0 then +11 | 11 |\n",
    "| 5 | `addLaps(5)` | 4 | No | 16 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learnings:**\n",
    "- Read the example table slowly — the reset timing is the whole puzzle\n",
    "- Three instance variables, no more, no less\n",
    "- Order inside `addLaps` matters — check before incrementing\n",
    "- The `&& callCount != 0` guard is easy to miss and will cause a wrong answer on call #1\n",

    "## FRQ 3 — playerWithClosestScore\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** The `PlayerAnalysis` class holds an `ArrayList` of `Player` objects. Each player has an ID (String) and a score (int). Given a `targetScore`, find and return the ID of the player whose score is closest to it. Ties can return either player.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public String playerWithClosestScore(int targetScore) {\n",
    "    String closestID = playerList.get(0).getID();\n",
    "    int closestDiff = Math.abs(playerList.get(0).getScore() - targetScore);\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (Player p : playerList) {\n",
    "        int diff = Math.abs(p.getScore() - targetScore);\n",
    "        if (diff < closestDiff) {\n",
    "            closestDiff = diff;\n",
    "            closestID = p.getID();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return closestID;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- Before the loop, you seed your \"best so far\" with the first player in the list — both their ID and their difference from the target. This gives the loop something real to compare against from the very first iteration\n",
    "- `Math.abs(p.getScore() - targetScore)` computes the absolute difference — how far away this player's score is from the target. Without `Math.abs`, a score lower than the target would give a negative number and always look \"smaller\" than it should\n",
    "- Inside the loop, if the current player's difference is strictly less than the best seen so far, you update both variables together — you need both the new minimum difference and the ID that goes with it\n",
    "- After the loop, `closestID` holds the winner\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traced through the example (targetScore = 1000):**\n",

    "| PTT | 3500 | 2500 | No |\n",
    "| JAY | 4500 | 3500 | No |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learnings:**\n",
    "- Seed with `playerList.get(0)` — starting with 0 or null as your baseline leads to wrong answers\n",
    "- `Math.abs()` is non-negotiable when comparing distances\n",
    "- Always call `getScore()` and `getID()` — the exam expects you to use the interface, not access fields directly\n",
    "- Update both `closestDiff` and `closestID` together — forgetting one breaks the whole thing\n",

    "\n",
    "## FRQ 4 — countOrderedRows\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** You have a 2D array of Strings called `grid`. A row is \"ordered\" if every string in it has a length greater than or equal to the string before it — shortest to longest, left to right. Count how many rows in the grid meet this condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int countOrderedRows() {\n",
    "    int count = 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {\n",
    "        boolean ordered = true;\n",
    "\n",
    "        for (int col = 1; col < grid[row].length; col++) {\n",
    "            if (grid[row][col].length() < grid[row][col - 1].length()) {\n",
    "                ordered = false;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        if (ordered) {\n",
    "            count++;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return count;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- The outer loop walks through every row using `grid.length` (number of rows)\n",
    "- `boolean ordered = true` is declared fresh inside the outer loop — it resets for every new row, which is what you want\n",
    "- The inner loop starts at `col = 1`, not 0 — because you're comparing each element to the one before it (`col - 1`), and there's nothing before index 0\n",
    "- `grid[row][col].length() < grid[row][col - 1].length()` compares the string lengths, not the strings alphabetically. If the current string is shorter than the previous one, the row is not ordered\n",
    "- Once `ordered` flips to false, there's no reason to flip it back — any single violation disqualifies the whole row\n",
    "- After the inner loop finishes, if `ordered` is still true, that row passed and gets counted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traced through the example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Row | Words | Lengths | Ordered? |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 0 | cat, crane, people, hamster | 3, 5, 6, 7 | Yes — strictly increasing |\n",
    "| 1 | dog, slate, bat, green | 3, 5, 3, 5 | No — bat(3) < slate(5) |\n",
    "| 2 | blue, audio, adieu, snazzy | 4, 5, 5, 6 | Yes — equal counts too |\n",
    "| 3 | yellow, shirt, hat, store | 6, 5, 3, 5 | No — shirt(5) < yellow(6) |\n",
    "| 4 | about, media, stone, canoe | 5, 5, 5, 5 | Yes — all equal is fine |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learnings:**\n",
    "- Inner loop starts at `col = 1`, always — starting at 0 causes an out-of-bounds error on `col - 1`\n",
    "- Compare `.length()` values, not the strings themselves\n",
    "- Equal lengths still count as ordered — the condition is `<` not `<=`\n",
    "- `grid.length` = number of rows, `grid[row].length` = number of columns in that row\n",
    "- The boolean flag pattern is the cleanest way to handle \"did anything go wrong in this row\""
